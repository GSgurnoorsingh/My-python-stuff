# My python notes

** Disclaimer **
This repository is a collection of my personal notes as i learn python.
It may be rough,incomplete or unpolished - mainly for my own reference.

Feel free to explore if you are also learning python,but keep in mind:
1) The code may not always follow best practices.
2) Explanations are written in my own learning style.
3) Some parts may be incomplete or experimental.

## Why i made this public
I believe in learning in public.  
Even if it's messy, someone else might find parts of this helpful â€” just like I benefit from others sharing their notes.

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** If you have suggestions or corrections, feel free to open an issue or pull request!
